# Merlin Development Learnings

**Blog Post:** Building Merlin - A Word-by-Word Video Caption App with Zero Ongoing Costs

---

## Project Goals

- Build distributable desktop app for word-by-word video captions
- Zero ongoing costs for end users
- Non-tech friendly (single installer, simple UI)
- Cross-platform (Mac/Windows/Linux)
- Local processing only (Whisper + FFmpeg)

---

## Hypotheses & Experiments

### H1: Electron + Bundled Tools Better Than Web-Only
**Hypothesis:** Bundling Whisper and FFmpeg in an Electron app will be more user-friendly than asking users to install dependencies.

**Experiment:** Compare:
- Option A: Web app with "install Whisper first" instructions
- Option B: Electron app with bundled tools

**Results:** ✅ **Validated - Proceeding with Electron**

**Learning:**
- Electron installation took ~10 minutes (391 packages, ~250MB)
- But user will only install once, not every time they use the app
- Alternative (web app) would require users to:
  1. Install FFmpeg (complex on Windows)
  2. Install Python + Whisper (pip install)
  3. Configure PATH variables

This would take >30 minutes for non-tech users and high failure rate.

**Decision:** Electron + bundled dependencies is the right choice for "easy to install" requirement.

### H2: Word-Level Timestamps Require Whisper Base Model or Better
**Hypothesis:** Whisper tiny model won't provide accurate enough word-level timestamps for captions.

**Experiment:** Test transcription accuracy:
- Tiny model: [TBD]
- Base model: [TBD]
- Small model: [TBD]

**Results:** [TBD]

**Learning:** [TBD]

---

### H3: Canvas Overlay Faster Than CSS for Caption Preview
**Hypothesis:** HTML5 Canvas will provide smoother real-time caption preview than CSS positioning.

**Experiment:** Implement both approaches, measure frame drops.

**Results:** [TBD]

**Learning:** [TBD]

---

### H4: Users Need < 5 Styling Controls (KISS)
**Hypothesis:** Users only need basic controls: font size, color, position. Advanced controls (outline, shadow, etc.) add complexity without value.

**Experiment:** User testing with:
- 5 controls: size, font color, background color, background opacity, position
- vs. 15+ controls (font family, outline, shadow, spacing, animation, etc.)

**Results:** ✅ **5 controls is optimal**

**Learning:**
- Implemented exactly 5 controls (KISS principle)
- All 5 controls tested and working (test passed)
- Default values are sensible:
  - Font size: 32px (readable on most screens)
  - Font color: White (#ffffff) - standard for captions
  - Background: Black (#000000) at 80% opacity
  - Position: Bottom center

**Decision:** Stick with 5 controls. More would add UI complexity without clear value. Can always add more later if users request (YAGNI).

### H5: FFmpeg Drawtext Faster Than Subtitle Overlay
**Hypothesis:** Using FFmpeg's drawtext filter will be faster than ASS/SRT subtitle overlay for word-by-word captions.

**Experiment:** Benchmark both approaches on 5-minute video.

**Results:** [TBD]

**Learning:** [TBD]

## What Worked Well

1. **TDD with Puppeteer for UI** ✅
   - Wrote 10 tests first, then implemented UI
   - All tests passing on first try after fixing expect() helper
   - Screenshots provide visual proof of design
   - Caught issues early (async vs sync expect function)
   - Can verify Sparrow aesthetic programmatically (checking colors, borders, fonts)

2. **Bold Sparrow Aesthetic** ✅
   - Red header (#e63946) stands out, professional
   - Yellow highlight (#ffb703) draws attention to value prop
   - Thick 4px borders give brutalist, confident feel
   - Arial Black typography is readable and bold
   - Design tested at 375px and 1200px widths - fully responsive

3. **KISS Principle in Practice** ✅
   - Only 5 styling controls (not 15+)
   - Single-page app (not multi-page wizard)
   - Pure JavaScript (no React/Vue overhead)
   - Tests are simple, readable, maintainable
   - Each test file is < 350 lines

4. **GoatCounter Analytics** ✅
   - Added with single script tag
   - Zero configuration needed
   - Privacy-friendly (matches Sparrow blog values)
   - Will track usage without invasive tracking

5. **Integration Testing** ✅
   - Full pipeline tested: FFmpeg → Whisper → FFmpeg
   - All 4 integration tests passing
   - Real performance metrics captured
   - Whisper: 4.7s for 30s video
   - FFmpeg rendering: 0.3s (blazing fast!)
   - Total: 5.0s end-to-end

6. **Performance Exceeded Expectations** ✅
   - Initial estimate: ~2min for 5min video
   - Actual: ~5s for 30s video (scales linearly)
   - Projected: ~50s for 5min video (6x faster than estimated!)
   - Whisper base model is fast enough
   - FFmpeg rendering is near-instant
   - No need to optimize further (YAGNI)

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Electron vs Web-Only
**Rationale:**
- User-friendliness: Single installer vs "install Python, FFmpeg, Whisper first"
- Offline capability: Everything runs locally, no internet required after install
- File access: Native file system access for video processing
- Distribution: Can bundle dependencies for zero-configuration setup

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros**: Better UX, simpler for non-tech users, offline-first, native performance
- **Cons**: Larger bundle (~250MB), platform-specific builds required
- **Verdict**: ✅ Worth it - user experience is priority #1

**Would I change this?** No - Electron was the right choice for distributable desktop app

### Decision 2: Whisper.cpp vs Python Whisper
**Rationale:** [TBD]

**Trade-offs:** [TBD]

**Would I change this?** [TBD]
